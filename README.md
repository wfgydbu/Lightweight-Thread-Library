# Homework 1: Lightweight Threads V1

First Homework on LWT Thread creation and deletion.

- Find the homework specification in `csci_6411_lwt.pdf`
- Find the dispatch function's prototype in `lwt_dispatch.h`, and the implementation in `lwt_dispatch.o`.

## Deadline

This assignment is due on Monday, February 6th at midnight.
Your last commit before this deadline counts as your submission.

## Using `git`

Please remember to make many small commits.
I want to see a story of progress through your commits, not a single large dump of a bunch of code.
This will be good practice in how to use version control systems properly.

For the most part, you'll find that 99% of the time, the following commands are sufficient

- `git commit -a`
- `git diff`
- `git status` (*always* use this before committing)
- `git diff -stat`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git clone`

You can learn about each of these using the internet, or `git help X` where `X` is the command portion of the above examples.
